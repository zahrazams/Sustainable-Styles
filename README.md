# Sustainable-Styles
Sustainable Styles is an app designed to counteract and spread awareness about fast fashion through the sharing of resources and an interactive quiz that allows users to test their knowledge on the issue. Using Xcode and SwiftUI to develop the app, the developers incorporated quite a few functionalities with the app including embed webpages that allow users to open external links and create a quiz feature that allows the user to test their knowledge of fast fashion.
